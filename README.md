Introduction
* This project analyzes college football data to predict College Football Playoff (CFP) rankings. Through the incorporation of various metrics such as Strength of Record (SOR), team statistics, and conference metrics, the project provides insights into team performance and generates an automated CFP projection.

Features
* Scrapes and consolidates team performance data from multiple sources.
* Includes conference-level rankings based on aggregated team metrics.
* Utilizes Strength of Record (SOR) for more accurate evaluations.
* Automates the process of ranking teams using customizable scoring algorithms.
* Provides output files including cleaned data, team scores, and CFP predictions.
 
Getting Started
* Prerequisites
  1. Python 3.10+
  2. Git for version control
  3. Libraries: pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4
 
Installation
* Clone the repository:
  * git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
* Navigate to the project directory:
  * cd your-repository-name
* Install required Python packages:
  * pip install -r requirements.txt
 
Project Workflow
1. Data Scraping
  * Scripts Used: scraping.py, scraping_sor.py
  * Purpose: Collect team performance statistics and Strength of Record (SOR) data from various sources.
2. Data Transformation
  * Script Used: transform.py
  * Purpose: Clean, normalize, and structure the scraped data. Adds derived metrics like win percentage and point differential.
3. Statistical Analysis
  * Script Used: stats_ranking.py
  * Purpose: Ranks conferences based on aggregated team statistics and calculates conference multipliers for team scoring.
4. CFP Prediction
  * Script Used: cfp_predictor.py
  * Purpose: Generates a CFP prediction by scoring teams using SOR, conference multipliers, and other performance metrics.

File Descriptions
* scraping.py: Collects raw team data from web sources.
* scraping_sor.py: Retrieves Strength of Record (SOR) data.
* transform.py: Cleans and normalizes the raw data, incorporating SOR and other metrics.
* stats_ranking.py: Calculates conference rankings and multipliers.
* cfp_predictor.py: Scores teams and generates the final CFP projection.
* README.md: Documentation for the project.
* requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
* Data files (e.g., raw_cfb_data.csv, cleaned_cfb_data.csv, team_score.csv, etc.).

How to Use
* Run the scraping scripts to collect data:
  * python scraping.py
  * python scraping_sor.py
* Transform the raw data:
  * python transform.py
* Rank conferences and generate multipliers:	
  * python stats_ranking.py
* Generate the CFP projection:
  * python cfp_predictor.py
* Output files (e.g., team_score.csv, cfp_prediction.csv) will be saved in the project directory.
